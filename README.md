## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **AWS Glue** - Managed ETL service for data transformation
- **Amazon S3** - Storage for raw and processed data
- **AWS Athena** - Serverless query engine for data analysis
- **AWS Glue Crawlers** - Automated schema discovery and metadata management
- **AWS Databases (RDS, DynamoDB)** - Data storage solutions
- **AWS QuickSight** - Business intelligence and visualization
- **IAM Roles** - Security and access control
- **Encryption** - Secure data management

## Prerequisites 📋
Ensure you have the following set up:
- AWS account with necessary permissions
- AWS CLI configured with IAM roles
- S3 buckets for data storage
- AWS Glue, Athena, and QuickSight services enabled

## Installation & Setup ⚡

### Step 1: Setup S3 Buckets
1. Create an S3 bucket for raw data storage.
2. Create another S3 bucket for processed data.

### Step 2: Configure AWS Glue
1. Create AWS Glue Crawlers to scan S3 data and create table schemas.
2. Set up AWS Glue Jobs for data transformation.

### Step 3: Query Data with Athena
1. Create an Athena database.
2. Define tables using Glue Catalog.
3. Execute SQL queries to analyze data.

### Step 4: Create Dashboards in QuickSight
1. Connect QuickSight to Athena.
2. Build visual reports and dashboards.

### Step 5: Implement Security & Optimization 🔒
1. Use IAM roles to manage access.
2. Encrypt data stored in S3.
3. Optimize queries for cost efficiency.
