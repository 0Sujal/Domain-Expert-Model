# Project Description:

This project explores the fine-tuning of a Meta Llama 2 7B model within the financial domain. The primary goal is to enhance the model's ability to generate contextually relevant and accurate responses to financial prompts. The project leverages Amazon Web Services (AWS) for infrastructure and resources, demonstrating the practical application of generative AI in a real-world scenario.

# **Key Steps:**

**Domain Selection:** The financial domain was chosen for fine-tuning due to its complexity and the potential value of a specialized language model.

**Model Evaluation:** The initial performance of the model was assessed using domain-specific inputs. The responses, while somewhat relevant, lacked the depth and accuracy desired for financial applications.

**Fine-Tuning:** The model underwent fine-tuning using a curated dataset of financial text. This process aimed to align the model's parameters with the nuances of financial language and concepts.

**Post-Fine-Tuning Evaluation:** The fine-tuned model was re-evaluated using the same domain-specific inputs. The responses showed significant improvement in terms of relevance, accuracy, and depth of understanding.

# Technical Details:

Model: Meta Llama 2 7B

**Infrastructure:** Amazon Web Services (AWS)

**Libraries:** Transformers, PyTorch, etc. (Specific libraries used for fine-tuning and evaluation)

# Results:

The fine-tuned model demonstrated a notable enhancement in its ability to generate financial text. It produced responses that were not only contextually relevant but also informative and accurate. This project highlights the potential of generative AI to revolutionize how we interact with and utilize information within specialized domains.

# Future Work:

Further fine-tuning with a larger and more diverse financial dataset.

Exploration of other generative AI models and architectures.

Development of a user interface for interacting with the fine-tuned model.
